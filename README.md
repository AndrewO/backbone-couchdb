I developed this connector because I didn't want to write an own server that persists 
the models that Backbone.js ceated. Instead I now only have to write a simple design document 
containing one simple view and I'm done with server-side code. 
Also I wanted to have a way to get real time updates for my models, which can easily be
achieved with the couchdb changes feed.
So have fun reading the docs, checking out the [example couchapp](http://backbone.couchone.com/backbone-couchapp/_design/backbone-couchapp/index.html) and [RELAX](http://vimeo.com/11852209) :D
